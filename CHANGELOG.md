# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-29

- **Help:** the user documentation in the app, bundled so it works offline and on a phone:
  getting started, projects, agents, version control and CI, remote access and the phone
  (including Tailscale), running as a service, and `config.toml`. Open it with F1, the
  palette, the status bar's Help, or More → Help on a phone; search covers every page.
- **Docs:** a plan for porting the server to Windows ([windows-port.md](docs/windows-port.md)).

**Install:** Linux x86_64 (glibc 2.35 or newer): unpack
`workbench-0.2.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` and run `./install.sh`, then restart
Workbench (`systemctl --user restart workbench.service` or the running `workbench serve`).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-29

First public release.

- **Agents:** Claude Code, Codex, Kimi Code, Gemini CLI, Aider and custom CLIs in real
  terminals; permission requests answered from cards, toasts and the phone; Review Changes
  with per-file and whole-session revert; Claude Code Remote Control; MCP tools for the
  UI, CI, Confluence and Jira, Workspace cards, runs, code intelligence, the debugger and
  Local History.
- **Editor:** Monaco on CLion's keymap, language servers with semantic highlighting,
  hierarchies and structure (presets from rust-analyzer and clangd to Verible for
  Verilog and SystemVerilog and vhdl_ls for VHDL), a DAP debugger, Local History,
  bookmarks, compare, scratch files and an HTTP client for `.http` files.
- **Version control:** line staging and partial commits, changelists, the shelf,
  interactive rebase, bisect and a log graph.
- **Forges:** GitLab merge requests, pipelines, jobs and test reports; GitHub pull
  requests, Actions runs and artifacts; issues on both.
- **Atlassian:** Confluence reading and authoring with inline comments, attachments and
  labels; Jira issues and boards.
- **Running things:** detected run configurations, environments with health checks,
  previews and gated deploys, dev containers, a Services window for Docker and a Database
  window for PostgreSQL.
- **Workspace:** deliverable cards with sandboxed reports, galleries, PDFs and 3D
  comparisons, compatible with Mr. Mak Workspace's registry; four example cards in Home
  on the first start.
- **Phone:** an installable app with its own tabs and push notifications.

**Install:** Linux x86_64 (glibc 2.35 or newer): unpack
`workbench-0.1.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` and run `./install.sh`, or build from
source. Windows is not supported yet.

**Update:** install the new release (or pull and rebuild), then restart Workbench
(`systemctl --user restart workbench.service` or the running `workbench serve`). Your
configuration and `~/.local/share/workbench` stay as they are.
